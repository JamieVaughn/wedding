  <h1>A reading by an anonymous author</h1>
  <p>
    <p>May your marriage bring you all the exquisite excitements a marriage should bring.</p>
    <p>May life grant patience, tolerance and understanding.</p>
    <p>May you always need one another â€“ not so much to fill your emptiness as to help you to know your fullness. A mountain needs a valley to be complete; the valley does not make the valley less but more; and the valley is more a valley because it has a mountain towering over it. So let it be with you and you.</p>
    <p>May you need one another - but not out of weakness.</p>
    <p>May you want each other - but not out of lack.</p>
    <p>May you entice one another - but not compel one another.</p>
    <p>May you embrace one another - but not encircle one another.</p>
    <p>May you succeed in all important ways with one another,</p>
    <p>and not fail in the little graces.</p>
    <p>May you look for things to praise, often say, "I love you" and take no notice of small</p>
    <p>faults. If you have quarrels that push you apart,</p>
    <p>May both of you hope to have good sense enough to take the first step back.</p>
    <p>May you enter into the mystery which is the awareness of one another's presence - no more physical than spiritual; warm and near when you are side by side; and warm and near when you are in separate rooms or even distant cities.</p>
    <p>May you have happiness, and may you find it making one another happy.</p>
    <p>May you have love and may you find it in loving one another.</p>
    <p>May the passing of time only enhance and accentuate this joyful sense of wonder on the journey you are beginning today.</p>
  </p>
